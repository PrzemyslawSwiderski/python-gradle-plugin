# Python Gradle Plugin
This Gradle Plugin uses [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
to run executables (`python`, `pip`, `conda` etc.) from virtual env.  

## Requirements
* Java JDK or JRE version 8 or higher

## Purpose
Running python scripts or projects by executing single tasks which will download and install Python virtual environment.

## Usage

### Steps to run python script from Gradle
1. Apply a plugin to a project as described on [gradle portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.pswidersk.python-plugin).
2. Configure a plugin by specifying desired python version in build script:
    ```kotlin
    pythonPlugin {
        pythonVersion.set("3.8.2")
    }
    ```
    Possible properties in plugin extension are:
    - `pythonVersion` -> Python environment version, default `3.8.5`
    - `minicondaVersion` -> Miniconda3 version, default `latest`
3. Define a task to run desired python script, for example to run `quicksort.py` script in `main` dir add the following task configuration to build script:
    ```kotlin
    tasks {
        register<VenvTask>("runQuickSort") {
                workingDir = projectDir.resolve("main")
                args = listOf("quicksort.py")
        }
    }
    ```
4. Run python script from gradle:
    ```shell script
    # Linux
    ./gradlew runQuickSort
    # Windows
    gradlew.bat runQuickSort
    ```

### Additional examples alongside with sample PipTasks configurations can be found in `examples` module in this project. 

## Intellij setup
* To have autocomplete and modules properly recognized in Intellij Idea simply point python executable as described in: 
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-python-sdk.html
* To have properly recognized imported source modules in tests, right click on sources directory (for example `main`) -> `Mark Direcotry as` -> `as Sources root`.

### Python exec locations (`*` is a configured python version)

#### Linux - `.gradle/python/pythonVenvs/virtualenv-*/bin/python`

#### Windows - `.gradle/python/pythonVenvs/virtualenv-*/Scripts/python.exe`

## Common issues
* Python common build problems: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems
* in case of uninstalling venv from Windows, it can be necessary to run uninstall exec (downloaded in `build` directory) to fully uninstall python, 
deleting python venv dir could not be sufficient
* in case of any problems with installation on Windows try reinstalling (uninstall by msi installer in `build` dir and then execute once again `build_envs` task)
* installing python on Linux can require installation of additional packages, 
for example openssl, so before virtual envs installation run: `sudo apt-get install openssl`
